# Fitness-Tracker
## Description

* This application can be utilized to keep track of workouts performed throughout a day, over multiple days and multiple workouts. The information is stored during each ongoing workout so that a user can keep track of what they have been doing that day, and it keeps track of all workouts performed over a given week in a dashboard tracker off the main page.
The user currently has the option to choose between a cardio workout, or a resistance workout.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
